# Creative Collective "KonText"

## About Us

In early September 2023, in Leipzig, Germany, a small group of enthusiasts came together.  
The spark for this initiative was a simple but inspiring idea:  
“let’s read a short but fascinating story out loud — for an audience.”

Our group’s “birthday” can be traced back to September 27, 2023,  
when we created a shared WhatsApp chat called *“Grandma Fira’s Stew”*  
after one of our very first meetings.

## Who We Are

The name **KonText** was chosen by popular vote after our debut.  
We are a diverse group — different ages, backgrounds, professions —  
brought together by the idea of a *staged reading*:  
a theatrical presentation of carefully chosen material, read aloud.

## Why Staged Reading?

Because it’s simple — and doable.  
A staged reading doesn’t require major resources beyond the time and passion of its participants.  
Unlike a full play, everyone is interchangeable —  
if someone misses a rehearsal or a performance for a good reason,  
another participant can step in and read their part.

## What Matters Most

Our top priority is the choice of material.  
We follow two rules when selecting:

1. It has to be genuinely interesting to us — so much so that we *want* to share it with the audience. (Everyone in KonText takes part in this selection.)  
2. No politics.

## Our Concept

Our idea is to read the chosen text *by roles*,  
creating a kind of minimalist performance:  
no sets, no stage lighting (though we do use music), no costumes,  
no memorized lines — and with the flexibility to swap readers at any time  
(since most of us work full-time and sometimes travel).

Because this format is not a full play,  
we decided to call it a **staged reading** —  
or, in our own words, a **“chitakl.”**

## Staged Reading in Context

In Germany, this is a common phenomenon known as a *Lesung* —  
though usually in a different format:  
an author with a new book reads excerpts in theatres, libraries, bookstores, cafés,  
to attract an audience of potential readers.  

Sometimes they even read work-in-progress material, discuss it with the listeners,  
and use the feedback to decide how to develop the work further. (*)

> (*) We later discovered — while preparing new material after the premiere  
> of our first staged reading on January 8, 2024 (*Grandma Fira’s Stew*) —  
> that this practice is quite widespread and often used to promote new authors  
> and playwrights. There are even entire festivals dedicated to staged readings.

## What We’ve Done So Far

KonText has already presented several staged readings:

- **“Grandma Fira’s Stew”** based on stories by M. Yudovsky  
- **“What Women Think: Two Centuries – Four Ages”** based on stories by N. Teffi and a play by Yu. Voronova  
- **“What Women Think”** based on stories by N. Teffi  
- **“Diary”** based on a play by Yu. Voronova  

## Looking Ahead

We’re preparing new and exciting projects — and we’re always open to collaboration.

## Legal Status

KonText is registered as a **Civil Law Partnership** (*Gesellschaft bürgerlichen Rechts [GbR]*) —  
a form of joint activity that is **not** a legal entity.
