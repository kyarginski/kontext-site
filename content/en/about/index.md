# Creative Group "KonText"

## About Us

In early September 2023, in Leipzig, Germany, a small initiative group of like-minded people gathered together. The ideological inspiration was a proposal to "read a small but very interesting story to the public."

The birth date of our creative group can be determined as September 27, 2023, when we created a common WhatsApp chat called "Grandma Fira's Stew" after one of our first meetings.

## Creative Group "KonText"

This name was chosen from many suggestions by majority vote after our debut. We consist of people of absolutely different ages, education and occupations, united by the idea of "Readacle" (staged reading), the essence of which is absolutely simple: theatrical reading of carefully selected material.

## Why This Form?

Everything is quite simple here too: a readacle doesn't require any serious expenses except the precious time of the participants, and in a readacle, unlike a play, all participants are interchangeable. We are all adults, busy people, and we cannot always count on each other, therefore, each of us is ready to read the text of a colleague who, for a valid reason, did not come to a rehearsal or to the announced performance.

## The Main Criterion

To which we pay great attention is the selection of material for the upcoming readacle.

In our selection we follow two rules:

1. It should be interesting primarily to us, should be so interesting that we want to share it with the viewer/listener (all participants of "KonText" are involved in material selection)
2. No politics

## Concept

To read the selected material by roles. To make a certain minimalist performance: without decorations, without lighting support (we couldn't do without music, however), without costumes, without learned roles, with the possibility of substituting for each other at any moment. And since it's impossible to call this a full-fledged performance, it was decided to present it as a "Readacle" (staged reading by roles).

## Readacle

In Germany this is quite a frequent phenomenon, called Lesung (reading), though in a slightly different format: some author releases a new book, and he, with joy, but of course without altruism, on all available platforms (theaters, libraries, bookstores, cafes, etc.), reads excerpts from it in order to attract the attention of potential book-loving buyers. Sometimes authors read working materials of a book in the desire to share a thought with listeners, then discuss it, to know in which direction to move in their creativity further. (*)

> (*) Later, as it turned out in the process of selecting new material, after the release 
> of our first Readacle "Grandma Fira's Stew" on 8.1.2024, "Readacle" is not our 
> invention, it's quite a widespread practice, especially for promoting new authors/
> playwrights. There are even Readacle festivals.
