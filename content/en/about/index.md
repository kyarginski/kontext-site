# Creative Group "KonText"

## Who We Are

"KonText" is an independent creative group that explores contemporary reality through the prism of dramatic art. We create performances that raise sharp questions about people, society, and the times we live in.

## Our Philosophy

Context is what gives meaning to any statement, any action. We believe that theater should not just be entertainment, but a space for reflection, dialogue, and rethinking reality.

## Creative Approach

- **Contemporary Dramaturgy** — we work with texts by contemporary authors and classics in new interpretations
- **Interdisciplinarity** — we combine theater with video art, music, dance
- **Social Relevance** — our performances touch on important social issues
- **Experimentality** — we are not afraid to try new forms and methods
