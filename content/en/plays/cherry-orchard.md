## About the Performance

Our interpretation of Chekhov's "The Cherry Orchard" explores themes of social change and nostalgia in the modern world. The play speaks about losing the familiar world and the necessity to adapt to new realities.

## Concept

We transfer the action to the present day and show how people of different generations react to changes. The cherry orchard becomes a metaphor for everything we fear to lose.

## Cast

- **Lyubov Ranevskaya** - Elena Vremeni
- **Lopakhin** - Mikhail Smyslov
- **Anya** - Maria Dialog

## About the Production

The performance combines classical text with modern theatrical techniques. We use multimedia elements and create an atmosphere that is both nostalgic and forward-looking.
