## About the Performance

Our modern interpretation of Shakespeare's "Hamlet" explores the timeless themes of power, corruption, and moral choices through the prism of contemporary reality.

## Concept

The play takes place in an abstract space where past and present merge. We use elements of immersive theater, where the audience becomes witnesses to the protagonist's inner struggles.

## Cast

- **Hamlet** - Mikhail Smyslov
- **Ophelia** - Elena Vremeni  
- **Claudius** - Dmitry Prostranstvo
