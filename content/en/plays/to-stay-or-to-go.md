How to live? Where to work? And what to do with the cat? The story of a young man who cannot find a job in his homeland and tries to go abroad. But something goes wrong... again and again. A staged reading of this ironic comedy in the format of phone conversations may remind you of some pages of your life or the lives of your acquaintances.
