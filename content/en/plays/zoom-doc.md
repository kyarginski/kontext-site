## About the Performance

"Zoom.doc" is a documentary performance about how the COVID-19 pandemic changed our lives, relationships, and ideas about intimacy. Based on real stories collected during the lockdown.

## Concept

The performance is built on real zoom conversations that the theater's leading actors recorded during the pandemic. This is theater-research about how technologies became mediators in our most intimate moments.

## Scenography

The stage reproduces the video conference interface: several screens where viewers see actors in a "home" setting. The boundary between real and virtual space is deliberately blurred.

## Cast

- **Mikhail Smyslov** — IT specialist working from home
- **Elena Vremeni** — doctor forced to live separately from family
- **Dmitri Prostranstvo** — teacher mastering online education
